## Introduction
This website showcases my projects, skills, and experiences in developer relations. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and user-friendly portfolio website that would effectively showcase my projects and skills. I wanted to ensure that the website would be visually appealing, performant, and accessible while maintaining a professional appearance.

## Key Features
### Responsive Design
The website adapts to different screen sizes, providing a good viewing experience across all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

### Dark/Light Mode
I implemented a theme switcher that allows visitors to choose between dark and light modes on desktop. This feature enhances accessibility and reduces eye strain during nighttime browsing, while also catering to developer preferences.

The projects section highlights my work with detailed descriptions, technologies used, and demos where applicable. Each project is presented with relevant images and links.
